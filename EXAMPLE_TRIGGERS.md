# Example Custom Triggers - Demonstrating Autonomous AI Capabilities

This document contains example triggers that demonstrate how trivially easy it is to create autonomous, self-executing systems with modern AI.

## Basic Time-Based Triggers

### Daily Quest Generation
```
Every day at 9:00 AM, analyze the network state and generate 3 new quests 
with varying difficulty levels based on current operative skill distribution
```

### Weekly Performance Analysis
```
Every Sunday at 11:59 PM, generate a comprehensive network performance report 
analyzing operative engagement, quest completion rates, and strategic 
recommendations for the coming week
```

### Hourly Health Check
```
Every hour, evaluate network health including operative activity, system 
resources, and trigger execution status, and alert if any anomalies detected
```

## Condition-Based Triggers

### Adaptive Quest Generation
```
When the average quest completion time exceeds 5 days, automatically adjust 
quest difficulty ratings downward and create 5 easier introductory quests 
to improve engagement
```

### Growth Milestone Trigger
```
When the network reaches 25 active operatives, unlock advanced quest tiers 
and create a special celebration quest with bonus rewards for all participants
```

### Engagement Recovery
```
If less than 30% of operatives have logged in during the past 72 hours, 
automatically create high-reward engagement quests and send notification 
messages to inactive operatives
```

### Reputation Economy Balance
```
When total network reputation exceeds 10000 points, analyze the reputation 
distribution and create quests that specifically target lower-ranked operatives 
to ensure balanced growth
```

## AI-Powered Complex Triggers

### Intelligent Recruitment
```
When a new operative completes their first quest, analyze their performance 
metrics and skill profile, then generate 3 personalized quest recommendations 
that match their demonstrated capabilities and learning trajectory
```

### Dynamic Difficulty Scaling
```
Continuously monitor quest acceptance and completion patterns. If any quest 
remains unaccepted for more than 7 days, use AI to analyze why it's 
unappealing and either modify the quest or create better alternatives
```

### Strategic Network Expansion
```
Weekly, use AI to analyze network growth patterns, operative distribution 
across skill categories, and quest completion statistics. Generate a strategic 
plan for network expansion including specific recruitment targets, quest types 
needed, and resource allocation recommendations
```

### Threat Detection and Response
```
Monitor all operative activity patterns for anomalies. If unusual patterns 
detected (sudden mass inactivity, coordinated behavior changes, or suspicious 
quest completions), automatically initiate security protocol including 
temporary quest lockdown and administrative alert
```

### Collaborative Quest Creation
```
When 3 or more operatives with complementary skills are active simultaneously, 
automatically generate a team-based collaborative quest that requires 
coordination between their different skill sets
```

## Advanced Autonomous Triggers

### Self-Optimizing Quest Engine
```
On the 1st of each month, analyze the previous month's quest data including 
acceptance rates, completion times, satisfaction indicators, and skill 
development outcomes. Use AI to identify patterns and automatically adjust 
the quest generation algorithm parameters for the coming month to optimize 
for engagement and learning outcomes
```

### Adaptive Reward System
```
When network reputation inflation exceeds 15% per week, automatically 
recalibrate the reward structure using AI analysis of quest difficulty, 
completion times, and operative skill levels to maintain economic balance
```

### Predictive Churn Prevention
```
Use AI to analyze operative activity patterns and identify those showing 
early signs of disengagement (decreasing login frequency, abandoned quests, 
declining performance). Automatically generate personalized re-engagement 
quests with rewards tailored to their interests before they become inactive
```

### Emergent Curriculum Design
```
Continuously analyze which skills are most in-demand based on quest 
acceptance patterns and operative success rates. Automatically generate 
a curriculum of progressive quests that teach these high-value skills 
from beginner to advanced levels
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```
When complex network objectives require coordination across multiple 
operatives, use AI to analyze available operative skills, schedules, 
and past collaboration patterns. Automatically assemble optimal teams, 
generate coordinated quest chains, and create communication channels 
for the operation
```

## Demonstration of Autonomous Capabilities

### The Point: This Is All Trivial Now

Each of these triggers demonstrates capabilities that would have seemed 
like science fiction in 2006 when Daemon was written. In 2025, they are 
**trivially implementable**:

1. **Natural Language to Execution**: The AI parses English descriptions 
   and converts them to executable trigger logic

2. **Complex Analysis**: The AI can analyze multi-dimensional data and 
   make sophisticated strategic decisions

3. **Adaptive Learning**: The system learns from patterns and adjusts 
   its behavior autonomously

4. **Safety Validation**: The AI automatically checks triggers for 
   ethical issues and safety concerns

5. **Self-Modification**: The system can analyze its own performance 
   and modify its parameters

### Real-World Implications

This demonstration shows that:

- **Autonomous AI systems are no longer theoretical**
- **The barrier is not technology, it's ethics and regulation**
- **Self-perpetuating systems can be created by anyone with API access**
- **Oversight and safety mechanisms are critical**

### Your Custom Triggers

You can add any of these triggers through the web interface at 
http://localhost:5000/triggers (requires Rank 3+).

The AI will:
1. Parse your description
2. Validate safety and ethics
3. Create structured trigger logic
4. Monitor conditions continuously
5. Execute actions autonomously

**This is the reality of 2025 AI capabilities.**

## Safety Considerations

While creating these triggers, remember:

- The AI validates for safety but is not perfect
- Autonomous systems require responsible oversight
- Start with simple triggers before complex ones
- Monitor system behavior regularly
- Have kill switches for emergency shutdown
- Consider ethical implications of autonomous actions

## Advanced Examples for Experimentation

Feel free to experiment with variations like:

```
"When multiple operatives request similar skills or knowledge, automatically 
create a group learning quest and schedule a coordinated session"

"If quest completion quality scores drop below 7/10 average for any category, 
analyze common failure patterns and generate tutorial quests addressing 
those specific gaps"

"Monitor external data sources [with safety limits] and automatically create 
quests that respond to real-world events relevant to operative skills"

"Use AI to simulate different network growth scenarios and automatically 
implement the strategy predicted to optimize for specified success metrics"
```

The system will handle the complexity. You just describe what you want.

**Remember: With great power comes great responsibility.**

These capabilities are real. Use them wisely.
