DAEMON is a PoC framework that demonstrates how the once-fictional autonomous AI systems described in Daniel Suarezâ€™s Daemon can now be built with modern APIs like Claude and GPT-5. It features a self-running backend that interprets natural-language triggers, generates quests, validates ethics and safety, and executes actions autonomously.
